# Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The client in this project was The Gaming Room. A game company that needed help in creating some of the backbone of their code for their multiplayer drawing game, Draw It or Lose It. In the documentation I was able to give the pros and cons of what creating this on different platforms would entail. While now I would like to revise some of it such as the recommendations with more details to expalin to them why I chose the platform I did for the best success in building their game. The design helped when creating the application because I was more concince of how I was creating it for a platform and was able to look at how it would work differently on seperate operating systems. When creating the sofware I had to keep in mind and think about what the client would want, as it is supposed to be built to their ideas and needs. I found this very important because if I was the client I would want the things that I asked for or needed in my application. Using this approach helped me to think intuitively from the clients view.
